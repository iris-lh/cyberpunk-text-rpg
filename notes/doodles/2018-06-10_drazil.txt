What if right after you woke up each day, you already knew how your day would play out?

Today you might wake up, grab your phone off your nightstand, and scroll through Facebook in bed for 15 minutes before getting up.

What if in the future, you were able to visualize and explore countless possible paths the day could take?

What if I stand up to my boss instead of staying silent?
What if you ask your crush to coffee instead of drinks?
What if I talked to the stranger on the train?
What if I had eaten cereal for breakfast instead of eggs?

You can simulate as many possibilities as you can conceive.

And when you've considered your options and mulled them over, you can come back to the real world with a better understanding of your situation.
You can go through your day with confidence and intentionality.

Drazil is not so much a medication as it is a mission to help people.

We help people achieve their goals.
We help people navigate life's challenges.
We help people live the way they want.

Sometimes you just need some time to think.
